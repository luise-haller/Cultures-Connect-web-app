                How the idea came to be...
            </p>
            <p class="aboutText">
                The summer before my junior year, I was reading a tower of culturally diverse fiction and nonfiction books when I made one distinct realization.
                <span style="color: #e32276; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-weight: 700; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">
                    "To embrace diversity, you must know diversity." 
                </span>
                Essentially, for a person to be able to welcome the diversity of cultures from all around the world, this person first has to be exposed to different types of cultures to truly know the meaning behind "diversity." <br>
                And this quote is where the idea for this web app all started. I knew from being a technologically-active teenager that a large pool of people out there have not had the chance to grow up in a culturally diverse community and have not been fortunate enough to learn about all the different kinds of cultures the world has to offer. <br>
                My goal is to 
                <span style="color: #e32276; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-weight: 700; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">
                    bring the knowledge to you
                </span>
                in the form of bite-sized daily cultural facts so that it can be the most convenient way for you to become a well-rounded citizen of the world!
