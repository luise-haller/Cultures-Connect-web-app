                The summer before my junior year, I was reading a tower of culturally diverse fiction and nonfiction books when I made one distinct realization. "To embrace diversity, you must know diversity." And this quote is where the idea for this web app all started. I knew from being a technologically-active teenager that a large pool of people out there have not had the chance to grow up in a culturally diverse community and have not been fortunate enough to learn about all the different kinds of cultures the world has to offer. And wanting these people to also have an opportunity to learn more about the world and embrace the diversity that makes up our society, I hoped to find a way to bring the knowledge to them in small and bite-sized pieces to make it the most convenient way for them. This way, these people could save valuable work time (or just family time) trying to find reliable and long documentaries and articles about specific cultures. Instead, they could open the web app and get a new and enlightening cultural fact each day, becoming a more well-rounded human being each day.
